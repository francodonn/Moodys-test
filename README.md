This Repo contains a simple implementation of the Quantum circuit proposed in the paper entitled (Copula-based Risk Aggregation with Trapped Ion Quantum Computers)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.11937.pdf].
The notebook in this repo builds a parametrized quantum circuit implementing a Quantum Circuit Born Machine like the one in the following diagram:
